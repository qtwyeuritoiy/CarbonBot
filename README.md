# CarbonBot
Multi-Platform Chatbot in Python.

⚠️ This project is of early alpha quality. The structure and plugin API can change dramatically.

This project aims to work on virtually any IM platform at will. Currently, adapters are developed for IRC and the Telegram Bot API.

This program is designed to be runnable on Heroku, but it can be run anywhere you have Python ≥3.6 and pipenv. Install dependencies with `pipenv install` and run with `pipenv run ./carbonbot.py`.
